Data scientist working on predictive modeling and applied statistical problems within mental health care/biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University. I've maintained lifelong interests in philosophy and mathematics, and more recently I've become intrigued by the applications of quantitative methods within the social and psychological sciences. Closely following related research in network geometry, topological data analysis, and machine learning under non-Euclidean frameworks. <br>

Hoping to contribute towards a greater mathematical understanding of complex social and psychological systems from first principles, to test the limits of science and to both deepen our understanding and advance human wellbeing, to bridge the gaps between the natural and the social, and the theoretical and the applied.
