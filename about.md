Data scientist working on personalized recommendation models and customer segmentation, with lifelong interests in philosophy and mathematics. Intrigued by the applications of quantitative methods within the social and psychological sciences, and closely following related research in network geometry, topological data analysis, and machine learning under non-Euclidean frameworks. <br>

Hoping to contribute towards a greater mathematical understanding of complex social systems from first principles, to test the limits of science and to both deepen our understanding and advance human wellbeing, to bridge the gaps between the natural and the social, and the theoretical and the applied.
